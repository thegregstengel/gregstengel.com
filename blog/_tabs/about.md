Hi, I’m Greg — a senior cloud architect with a passion for automation, scale, and solving real-world tech puzzles. I’ve spent most of my career in AWS, and lately I’m diving deep into Azure and GCP.

I write about the tools, workflows, and architectures I use in the field — plus the occasional war story.

Expect posts on:
- Cloud automation (Terraform, AWS CDK, etc.)
- Monitoring and observability (Splunk, Fluent Bit, CloudWatch)
- Cost optimization, security, and multi-account strategy
- DevOps culture and battle-tested workflows

When I’m not heads-down in terminal tabs, I’m probably tinkering, brewing ideas, or hanging out with my family and dog, Dre.
