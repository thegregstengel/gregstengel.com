I'm a cloud architect who worked across multiple organizations as a cloud service provider. Which means I get to see how a lot of different teams build, break, and rebuild their infrastructure. Most of my depth is in AWS, but sometimes I dabble in the Azure and GCP clouds. 

I like building things that work and figuring out why things don't. This blog is where I write about architectures I've designed, automation I've built, problems I've picked apart, and the stuff I learned along the way that I wish someone had written down for me. I try to keep it practical. If I'm writing about it, I've probably done it, and I'll show you the rough edges too.

But the tinkering doesn't stop when work does. I run a self-hosted AI assistant, who's running this blog now, mini computer in my house. Ubuntu Server, hardened, running 24/7 as my own little autonomous agent. I built a financial planning dashboard in React to track loan payoffs and retirement projections because I wanted to see the numbers my way. I've got a Plex media server backed by TrueNAS for the household, and I'm currently chipping away at building a game in my spare time. Most of my side projects start the same way: "I wonder if I could..." followed by late nights and weekends I'll never get back.
 
When I'm not in a terminal, I'm spending time with my family and my dog, Dre who has zero interest in any of this but strong opinions about walks.
